# CppND-M5-Concurrency-L2_Project

## Project Tasks

**Task L1.1 :** In the base class TrafficObject, set up a thread barrier in its destructor that ensures that all the thread objects in the member vector _threads are joined.

**Task L1.2 :** In the Vehicle class, start a thread with the member function drive and the object this as the launch parameters. Also, add the created thread into the _thread vector of the parent class.

**Task L1.3 :** Vary the number of simulated vehicles in main and use the top function on the terminal or the task manager of your system to observe the number of threads used by the simulation.

You can find these tasks in the `project_tasks.txt` within the workspace as well.

## Build Instructions

To run this code using a Udacity workspace, you will need to use the virtual desktop. In the desktop you can use Terminator or the terminal in Visual Studio Code.

Once in the virtual desktop, to compile and run the code, create a build directory and use cmake and make as follows:
```
root@a9ad274128c4:/home/workspace/L2_Project# mkdir build
root@a9ad274128c4:/home/workspace/L2_Project# cd build
root@a9ad274128c4:/home/workspace/L2_Project/build# cmake ..
root@a9ad274128c4:/home/workspace/L2_Project/build# make
root@a9ad274128c4:/home/workspace/L2_Project/build# ./traffic_simulation
```
